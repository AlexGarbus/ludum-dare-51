_dialogue = "Alright Box baby! You know the rules here at TenSecBox! 10 seconds on the clock to knock out your opponent: Crate! Left and right to dodge, up to punch! Let's do this baby!
Great start, Box baby! You got this! Put all of that training to good use!
Keep it up, Box baby! Just remember what your ol' coach Shoebox taught ya! Left! Right! Up! Repeat!
Nice going, Box baby! He's starting to slow down. Now's your chance!
You've got him on the ropes, Box baby! Time to finish this!
He'll crumble any minute now! Stick and move, Box baby!
Aaany minute now!
...any minute now?
Hm... Y'know, I'm starting to get the feeling that taking a break every 10 seconds wasn't the best idea for a boxing match.
Are ya winning, son? I can't tell anymore.
Join the Alex Garbus Fun Club today! Box.
My expectations were low for you, but wow! How is this still not over yet?
It's a beautiful day outside. The birds are singing. The flowers are blooming. On days like these, kids like you... should hurry up and win!
You were expecting somebody else, but it was I! Shoebox!
It seems today, that all you see. Is violence in boxing and boxing on TV.
Are you getting these references or should I stop making them? I think I'm gonna stop.
